description: "Best choice for presenting a cappuccino? I don't know. In fact, I don't think anybody knows, because it all comes down to preference, but there's something about the way a cappuccino rests in these double walled glasses."

When it comes to presenting a cappuccino, there’s no definitive answer. Preferences vary, and while some may enjoy the traditional ceramic cup, others are drawn to the modern aesthetic of double-walled glasses.

Ceramic cups, which have a classic and timeless appeal. The weight of the cup, the feel of the handle, and the **warmth** of the ceramic all contribute to the overall experience of enjoying a cappuccino. Honestly, *ceramic cups are awesome*. They are some of my favourite cups to drink from, but that's for another post.

However, there’s something undeniably elegant about the way the layers of frothy milk and rich espresso are showcased in a double-walled glass. The glass allows you to see these layers in all their glory, creating a visual treat that is as satisfying as the taste of the cappuccino itself.

More than that, holding a double-walled glass feels different in your hands — there's a certain lightness to it, a hint of warmth that is different from the cozy embrace of a ceramic cup. It’s a different experience, but one that is equally enjoyable in its own way.
