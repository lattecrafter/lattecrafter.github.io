## Sweet breakfast

Yeah, I know, I know... not everyone is fan of sweet breakfasts. In fact, I'm not a fun either! However, sometimes I feel like I need a little bit of sugar in the morning. Chia pudding is a great option for those days when you want something sweet and healthy.

## How to make it

Keep in mind that this is an overnight recipe, so you can prepare it in a jar or in a really, really, really nice container (with a lid) and store in the fridge overnight. You'll wake up to a wonderful surprise in the morning!

### Ingredients

#### For the pudding

- 1/4 cup chia seeds and oats (mixed, kind of 70% chia and 30% oats)
- 1/6 cup raspberries (fresh or frozen)
- 1/4 cup milk (I used whole, but any kind will do)
- a tablespoon of honey
- a pinch of salt

#### For the topping

- greek yogurt mixed with honey, to taste
- banana slices
- a handful of fresh berries
- a sprinkle of granola

Make the chia pudding over night in the fridge, then top it with the greek yogurt, banana slices, fresh berries, and granola. Enjoy!
