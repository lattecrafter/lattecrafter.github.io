A good coffee is a great way to start the day, but it's even better when paired with a sweet treat. This recipe focuses more on the sweet side, with a brownie with a fruity twist - peach! üçë

## Ingredients

Honestly? I didn't save the recipe. Man, did I mess up. But I'll update this post as soon as I'll find a similar recipe. In the meantime, you can enjoy the photo of the brownie and the latte!
